## TODO: Implementation of "Programa Brasil Saudável" Landing Page

Based on the approved plan, here are the logical steps to complete the project. I'll update this file as steps are completed.

- [x] Generate necessary files: src/app/page.tsx, src/app/layout.tsx (for root layout if needed), and src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx
- [x] Create TODO.md to track progress (this file)
- [x] Install any new dependencies (none required)
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Run build: Execute `pnpm run build --no-lint` and fix any critical errors
- [x] Start server: Execute `pnpm start` in background
- [x] API Testing: Use curl to verify page load and basic functionality
- [x] Browser Testing: Use Playwright to test form, timer, and responsiveness (after API tests pass)
- [x] Retrieve preview URL
- [x] Final verification and fixes if needed

Progress: 9/9 steps completed. Project ready!
